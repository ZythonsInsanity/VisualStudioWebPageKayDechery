        If you're in trouble he will save the day.<br />

        He's brave and he's fearless, come what may.<br />

        Without him the mission would go astray.<br /><br />


        He's Arnold, Arnold, Arnold Rimmer.<br />

        Without him life would be much grimmer.<br />

        He's handsome, trim, and no-one slimmer.<br />

        He will never need a zimmer.<br /><br />


        He's Arnold, Arnold, Arnold Rimmer.<br />

        More reliable than a garden strimmer.<br />

        He's never been mistaken for Yul Brynner.<br />

        He's not bald, and his head doesn't glimmer.<br /><br />


        Master of the wit and the repartee.<br />

        His command of space directives is uncanny.<br />

        How come he's such a genius?<br />

        Don't ask me!<br /><br />


        Ask Arnold, Arnold, Arnold Rimmer.<br />

        He's also a fantastic swimmer.<br />

        And if you play your cards right<br />
        
        Then he just might come round for dinner.<br /><br />


        He's Arnold, Arnold, Arnold Rimmer.<br />

        No rhymes left now apart from quimmer.<br />

        We hope they fade us out before we get to "schlimmer".<br />

        Fade out you stupid blimmer!
